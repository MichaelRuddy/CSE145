This project’s focus was the research and future development of Triton AI’s three vehicles: a full size, 1/5 scale, and 1/10
scale which rely on IMU and GNSS data from hardware units designed by Point One Navigation. I configured and
established a reliable connection to the Atlas unit for the full size go kart. Additionally IMU data was extracted from the
P1SDK unit, which is used in the ⅕ scale kart, to be analyzed and compared with the other IMUs at our disposal. Currently
the P1SDK is being utilized only for GNSS data on the ⅕ kart, working in tandem with a separate IMU unit; hence it is
important to find out which setup of the resources available would provide the best performance and reliability benefits.
